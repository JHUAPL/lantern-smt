# Lantern: safer than a torch

Lantern is a software package to support SMT analysis of affine
multiplexing neural networks using PyTorch and Z3.

See: [docs/lantern/](docs/lantern/index.html) for (generated) documentation.

See: [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for dependencies.

An annotated `example.py` demonstrates basic usage.

Lantern was developed against `torch==1.5.0` and `z3-solver==4.8.7.0`.
